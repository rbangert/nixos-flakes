- Added [an experimental API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/vscode-serial-monitor-api) for communicating with the Serial Monitor extension [#20](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-serial-monitor/issues/20). This API should be considered unstable until it reaches version 1.0.0.

### Changed

- Enabled autoscroll by default and added persistence for autoscroll and show timestamp settings. [#52](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-serial-monitor/issues/52)
