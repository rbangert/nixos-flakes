Review Next Actions [Ideas]
The Next Actions list contains the rest of the actions that we have committed to do. These are actions that we should do as soon as possible, but without a specific date. How do we prioritize? Which one should we choose to do at each time? Well, the most appropriate according to the context in which we find ourselves, the time available to us, our energy and mood at that moment, and the relative priority of each task with respect to the others. All things being equal, we will choose the one that seems most important to us.
