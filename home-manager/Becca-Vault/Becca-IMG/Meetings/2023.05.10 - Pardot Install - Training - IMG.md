### Notes
---
This is about 45 minutes

- Need to be full admin access for the Install. After that they can take away Admin Access
- Install access to all users
- It doesn't hurt anything to re-install it, it will just update/upgrade it to the new version. 
Business Unit Setup
	Admin User - IMG 
Setup Assistant 
	Turn On anything that's turned off. Email, Engagement History Dashboards
Users
	Permission Sets
		Account Engagement Integration User (B2B Integration User)
		Account Engagement Connector User (B2B Integration User - may be phasing out)
		Account Engagement User
			- Add All Users (email content, lightning builder)
		Account Engagement Package
			- Allows them to acess the app?
		Analatics View Only User
			- Allows them to view the engagement history dashboards. Add All Users
	Sometimes you can only go so far because Pardot doesn't turn things on right away on the Salesforce Side *payment/subscription things*
Manage Connected Apps
	B2b canvas
		Manage Profiles (Select the profiles who need acceess to Pardot. She adds all users who she thinks are important)
Account Engagement App
	Go to Settings - Set it up with their User Info (put in their address)
Connectors 
	Fix Any Errors (Sometimes there's a weird one)
	Edit Settings
		Check off everything (doesn't link campaign yet)
		Turn on user sync (unless requested not to)
		Field level security - she turns it on for everyone
		B2b integration user permissions are not connected - KNOWN ISSUE
			As long as you know that everything is syncing correctly (no sync errors in the connector) then you can ignore it.

	Create Campaigns (2-4 min to push over)
	Then connect it

	CMS is turned off. Go to User, turn on CMS tabs in Profile (next to each other)
		Email Template, Email Content, Email Landing pages (all all for system admin, also check for other profiles that people are in)
	CMS Channel - Enable it. Turn on the domain (Pardot/Salesforce created it)
Account Engagement Connector
	Pulled over Campaign - Connect the Campaign 
Domain Management 
	Add domain in first box without www
	Tracker domain: go.domain.com
Add Google Analytic Connector
	Any other Connectors that they have mentioned
	- social ones are limited
