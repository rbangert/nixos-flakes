### Notes

Laura does both salesforce & pardot

Sales & Marketing Reports Folder
- You can usually tell when they are out of the box because the created date is the same as their org created dates. 
- Some comes with a pre-built dashboard and are centered around leads and opportunities
- Sales Manager ones are usually pretty good. 
- She viewed "Pipeline Report This Q"
- Report can be grouped by 3 columns, Dashboard you can select which column you want displayed on the chart if you don't want all three. 
- Any reports that are grouped do not export well to excel, they need to be flat. 

Salesforce has a Reporting Snapshot built in. 
- You make a custom object, and then you map the line items on the report to the custom object and then you create a report using those records. 
- 2000 lines limitation, so it has to be refined.
