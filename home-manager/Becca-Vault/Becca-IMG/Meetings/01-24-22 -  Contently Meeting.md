### Saw this this morning. Haven't looked into it yet.
![[chrome_66ZQXe2san.png]]

### I don't see these as options to map to Pardot
- ZoomInfo_Industry__c
-  ZoomInfo_Company_Revenue__c
- He is sending me directly to them. 
- He's going to put it in the Lead - 

### Source ID
Is actually a custom field, there's a Prospect Source that Pardot Uses, but this isnt it and I haven't had a chance to check into it.
Can't figure out an explanation for it -
	Remove it (at least from the form)

### How did you hear about Contently?
Added
-Salesforce - Push Over. 

### Clarification Needed:
I need a hidden, time/date stamped field for Campaign Name that should pull from the SF campaign name and carry through to the lead to allow us to see all the campaigns a lead was part of. 

-Confirms that she wants time stamp on this. She wants a timeline of how people go through campaigns. 

### GTM
Download Links
Doesn't really use right now. 
She thinks that they should use it. 

Use sooner than later on this - need to let him. 

Downloads 

Custom Landing Page - Through Wordpress 
Different landing page - different copy - different offer, different download, etc. 

Clone landing page and 

G2 - sending an email with a download is okay, but they haven't done that in the past. 

Goal Conversions set up in Google Analytics. 

Forms for Advertising - She doesn't know how to track things without that form. 

Campaign type - paid advertising
Campaign Name - Facebook - 2023

When she looks at a lead record and pull information on them. 

More focused on Lead Records - Dawn 
Rachel - prospects that don't become leads - fit criteria, shoot them an email. 

Current Report Marketing Qualified Leads - She wants to also report on Conversion to Leads (wants to know prospect to lead conversion rate)


Email vs Download from Link - They are concerned about 

Forms on the site, hasn't gone through - 

On Demand 

Verified that the GTM Was firing on the Form Complete - she's not sure what page - I asked if it was a download page. 

Sometimes they qualifiy themselves, and sometimes they don't. 
They would prefer to not have to qualify the leads themselves manually

ICP & Lead Score Rules - 

RingLead Tool at ZoomInfo they are changing their roundrobin more inteligent. 

The only forms that are automatically pushed to salesforce. Anyone who signs up for a demo request, on demand demo, and g2 report and meet the ICP. Those are auto pushed to salesforce and assigned.
