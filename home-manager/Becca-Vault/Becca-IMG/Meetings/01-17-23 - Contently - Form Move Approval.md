### Agenda

- How Granular are you wanting reporting?
	- There are ways to keep forms minimized and slightly dynamic. It requires some custom coding to create, and would be fairly difficult to maintain. 
	- It also limits reporting capabilities, and limits the completion actions.
- Best Practices for Prospect > Lead Conversion
	- Varies widely and should be customized to business & documented. 
- Forms to Move
	- Review Spreadsheet
		- Leave (do not touch)
		- Replace ("move")
		- Any other with high volume
		- The 3 with UTM Parameters
		- There seems to not be any downloads in the "Replace" category.
