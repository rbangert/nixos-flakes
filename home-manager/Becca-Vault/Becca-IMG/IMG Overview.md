###### Info from Katie Originally
_Our contractor team, AlphaCrew Studios:_
This is Ricky's team, they are our contractors that help with email template building (based off mockup or previous email template) and can also help build forms and landing pages. They will help with DNS, form integration, and landing page integrations. The form should be filled out with your IMG email, not the client's email.Â
