Hello Patrick, 

I added you & Shereen to the Asana Project. That's what is meant by the Implementation Plan. I have installed the package, and am starting on the rest of it as well. 

Something that was talked about in the KickOff but was undecided on how your team wanted to proceed was uploading existing Salesforce Contacts to Pardot. If you are intending to use Pardot to market to anyone currently in Salesforce we need to do an initial import. I can use a Salesforce Report, is there a list of contacts or leads your team wants uploaded to Pardot? 

I will be updating the Page Layouts on the Lead & Contact Object, and adding Engagement History Dashboards to the Lead, Contact, Account, and Campaign Objects. Are there specific layouts that your team wants updated and specific App Pages as well?

We can also comment on individual tasks in Asana so it's easy to see what each question is pertaining to. 


docker compose run --rm db psql -h db -U wikijs -d wiki

CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;

Took Screen shot of users. 
Cant find Shereen or the Salesforce Admin, I think I'm spelling name wrong.
