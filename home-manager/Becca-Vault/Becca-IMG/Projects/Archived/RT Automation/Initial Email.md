Thank you for your initial time today and look forward to working with you and the team!

1.  Please let me know what else I can provide in this initial request:

-   Eventually – would like the flow to identify if there is an order number associated with the email address and determine a filter to preassign.
-   This 1st year we just need to do some manual work to transition out of our old manual new customer process
-   **Was just thinking might be easier to build a 2nd flow to have in our toolbox to activate than to revisit in a year ?? thoughts?

2.  Here was another thing we had some questions on

-   Looking into updating the ‘Unsubscribe’ link in our emails to the ‘Email Preference Center’ link and it does not seem like the form/page is working.  It is not populating my email address and will not allow me to enter one.
-   For the Feb test, my assumption is that we would create new preference center pages but there does not seem to be an option to link to a custom page once they are created.  It only lets you link to the default page that is already set up.
-   Once we get that figured out, if contacts go in and update their preferences, how do we know who updated their preferences?  There is no list option to add them to within the preference page, so not sure how we keep track.

-    Perhaps the list keeps track but I cannot test because of #1 above

-   Unfortunately, right now the Unsubscribe link in all our emails does not give you the option of staying subscribed to some – it just unsubscribes you from everything with a click of the button :(  

3.  We also have an opportunity to do a similar import from another lead source,   I think this would be a similar initial components as what we are talking about with Woo to Salesforce import and task and then we create an automation funnel.

( I have attached those documents for your referencereview/thoughts?)
