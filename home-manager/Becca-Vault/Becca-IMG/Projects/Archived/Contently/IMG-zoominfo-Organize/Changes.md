title: **Created Technology Radar**
- This is for an idea I've had that I think would help you a lot, if you don't become obsessive and try to make it a database of all the knowledge and technology humans have ever produced. =p
- Right now, it's just a folder where I moved your **Books folder** and **Tools Rebecca Uses** note.
```

**Litter letter**
- I sorries, I want to find a way to respond to you when you're triggered by my actions, that results in a much better outcome.


**Created obsidian folder**
- His / Hers sub-folders
- Moved Vault Housekeeping folder (well, something duplicated it/put it back. So.... Also, why did you not move the dashboard?)
- Created project overview page (unfinished)
- Created work-template project page

**Created home/shopping lists folder**
- Moved Costco list
```
