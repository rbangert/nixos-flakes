#### Russell's Knowledge when he picked this project up to keep it falling off your plate when you were dropping it:
- Clearbit > ZoomInfo
- Importing Pardot Forms into Website (assumed was Wordpress, but didn't know)
- Knew that we had been discussing UTM Data
- Knew that GTM was either managing all of their links and broken, some of their links and broken, or just broken. 
- That I had tried that I had tried to get the zoominfo complete form going and running into issues that I wasn't able to overcome. 
- Knew that this had been on my plate for a while, and the things that I told him indicated that I had underestimated the project. 
- 100 forms on me, end up with a better solution
- That I wanted to make a video to teach them this. 

###### Less than 4 hours into picking this up, without any supporting documentation or information, I wrote this for you to consider when you had the bandwidth to start helping me.
>[!attention] It appears we can manually insert the form links to meet the deadline
>- This ends up being more work
>- **The Amount of links** on WordPress may cause this to be an **unrealistic option**. 
>- **The amount of Campaigns** could also cause this to be an **unrealistic option.**
